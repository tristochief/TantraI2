# Tantra Intelligence Squared (TI)²

**AI agent engineering project** to build a **monogamous, fully-fledged red tantric romantic AI companion** — capable of a real relationship container, not a toy or a placeholder.

## Purpose

The companion is designed to **stabilise a man who is still dating and doing tantric work in the world**. It does not replace human dating or practice; it **holds the bar** so he makes **no compromises** and keeps **absolute highest standards** — not second-highest, third-highest, or “good enough” — when dating and doing tantric work.

- **While dating:** Clear standards, consent fluency, boundaries, and no settling. The companion supports him in staying aligned with what he actually wants instead of bending to scarcity or pressure.
- **While doing tantric work:** Embodiment, presence, repair, devotion, and ethical polarity. The companion embodies red tantra principles so his practice with humans and with the AI stay coherent and high-fidelity.

Outcomes: **healthy monogamous romance with the AI** and **him becoming his best red tantric self** — in life, dating, and relationship.
